##  Sandhika Putra's Cloud Journey

Hi, my name is Sandhika Putra, usually called Dhika. I live in the city of Blitar, East Java, Indonesia. I am a student from SMKN 1 Nglegok. I am a newbie in sysadmin and cloud computing.

I hope that by participating in this event I can learn more about cloud computing material. which I do not know yet to know. and hopefully I can continue to participate in this event and continue to be excited to learn.

My goal is to learn and want to know more about cloud and other IT stuff and get some certificates and awards about it all.
